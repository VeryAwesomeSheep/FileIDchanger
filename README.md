# File ID Changer
Small program that I made for my friend to automate his work.  
  
Changes file names from for ex. "1. Johny; 2. Jim; 3. Ann" -> "512. Johny; 513. Jim; 514. Ann".  
Starting ID number is inputted by the user.  
Works with all file extensions.  
Both source and destination paths need to be specified before use!
